Have you ever wondered, what it would be like if you could track all your deliveries just with one app? Imagine a situation where you ordered a bunch of packages from different online stores. Let's say a vinyl from Amazon, a new phone from eBay and 2 phone cases from Wish. Wouldn't it be great to track all of those deliveries in realtime from one App? With Deliveries, you can! Be always aware where your deliveries are and when they arrive at your place. You can also simply see all the important information about each delivery. Try it out and you will never come back to track all your packages just by e-mail newsletters.
